# IO Mapping Editor

This directory contains UX explorations for the new edge-aware editor in the Workflow Generator experiment. The goal is to visualize how data flows between nodes and give users a clear way to bind outputs to downstream inputs. Use the mock HTML alongside the state-design document to align engineering and design decisions before implementation.
