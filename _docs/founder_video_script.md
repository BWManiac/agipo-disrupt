"Hi, I'm Jacobzen. I'm a technical PM who's scaled complex, multi-sided marketplaces to over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.

My vision for the future of work is one where every professional manages their own personal AI workforce. But for that to happen, we can't just be consumers of AI—we need to be creators.

That’s why I’m building AGIPO.

AGIPO is the marketplace for this future. You can hire agents to get work done, but the real magic is in creation. You train an agent the same way you’d onboard a new employee: by describing your tasks in plain English. We translate your unique process into a powerful, automated tool.

The feedback from our beta users has been incredibly positive because we're not just building a better automation tool; we're building the platform to create, manage, and scale the future of work."
