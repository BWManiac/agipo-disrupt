@YC.MD I'm going to go through and I'm going to answer all these questions. Your goal is to help me fill this out a little bit, right? And then maybe you can ask follow-up questions too so that we can make this more precise. So insofar as code and technical work, it's all been me and none of it has been done by a non-founder. So as for me, I am a technical product manager by trade. But yeah, I don't know what else to include here to make the application stronger. I would say, yes, I am looking for a co-founder. I would say while I am a very technical product manager and I've been able to implement and do all this very complex stuff myself, I realize that it's very important to have someone who's more focused on this stuff because my skills, while they're very strong technically, it's more important for me to be good at all the other stuff instead, right? Like the go-to-market, the product, vision, sales, all those sort of things, right? Then we need to work on the script for the one-minute video introducing the founders. So a little bit about myself. My name is Jacobson. I believe, you know, in a past life, I was a technical product manager at Anheuser-Busch and I launched a, you know, a B and I, you know, I'm a technical product, product manager who has expertises in marketplaces as well as in consumer products. In a past life, I was a product manager at Anheuser-Busch as well as a company called Protégé. At Anheuser-Busch, you know, the product that I helped launch was a product called Bees. And this was a B2B2B application that launched during the time of COVID. And during the first year, we did over $1 billion in gross market value through the application. As for my other product, you know, I scaled it from zero to over $100 million, $130 million in ARR, and there were a bunch of B2B2C. And, you know, it was very complex insofar as the marketplace there. Yeah. The company name is AGIPO. It's a GIPO. And, you know, a GIPO is a place where people can hire and manage their own AI agents as well as very easily create them. And, yeah. For the company URL, it's AGIPO.app. We do have a demo. And, yeah, we should also talk about, you know, what we want this demo to show. And feel free to read through the docs and the code as well to kind of inform that, too. I think it would be good if we planned it a little bit. And then, yeah. Right now, I live in L.A., but I would be looking at living in either New York or SF. I think my decision would be, you know, for my decision regarding location, ultimately, I'm committed to do whatever is best for the success for this product. However, given that this product is, you know, really geared towards a variety of white-collar workers, I think New York is a better place insofar as I already have a lot of context there. I think it's a better place for networking and discovery, especially among broader types of white-collar workers beyond just, for example, SaaS. And I think it's good to get out of a bubble because, you know, while a lot of this is going to be geared towards white-collar workers, I want this product to be geared also for consumers as well, right? Because, you know, a lot of the agents that I hope that will create are going to be useful for normal people as well for, you know, like managing their life and that sort of thing, right? Really, it's about making agents accessible. For how far along I am, I'd say I'm pretty early into this. I've been working on this. I guess, you know, I left my job in January of 2025 to really pursue and learn more about this space and really get familiar and learn how to code. And, you know, I think this is a product I've been wanting to build for a very long time. Yeah. And so far as active users, I have a few. There are more people like, you know, beta testers. None of them are paying me yet. And I have a small pipeline as well for people who are, I don't know, there's like a word for it, right? Like people who have kind of said that they're very interested in testing this too once it gets out of beta. So no revenue. I didn't apply with the same idea in a previous batch. And I haven't participated or committed in any sort of incubator accelerators or pre-accelerators. I do have domain expertise in this being the marketplace part as well as the consumer part. And I know people needed this because I've spoken to just so many users who have been on either side of the marketplace. You know, people who have, it's been really hard for them to create these workflow automations for because they had difficulty understanding how to use tools like N8N or Zapier. And then people on the agent purchasing side, you know, I spoke to like this venture capitalist from Japan who was describing how she had spent like over $200 like on courses and buying various N8N workflows. And it just, it was so hard for her to integrate it into her own life. So really a lot of the problems that we're solving here is making it easy for people to consume these integrations that other people are going to create. I think insofar as competitors, you know, there's N8N, there's Zapier, there are a couple other smaller ones. Those are the big ones. I think the thing that I understand that they don't is that their marketplace was more of an afterthought. Whereas for me, I'm making a main part of the product because making it easy for people to share the work that they do is absolutely critical. So, um, and I think it's also very important for, you know, for example, like the main interfaces, you know, to kind of humanize this with agents, right? And a lot of, for example, N8N workflows are stateless, but with our agents that I want to create, I want them to have memory. I want them to be chattable. I want them to be able to iterate and improve and be trained the same way you would a normal human, right? So that's another thing that I understand is really humanizing a lot of what can be done here. Uh, also in addition, you know, the problem with N8N and Zapier is that you're really forced to conform your way of thinking to whatever nodes they have available. But what I want to do is I want to programmatically generate nodes from scratch with code. Uh, you know, and I have a lot of first principles as well that I believe. Uh, and so far as, so we, we actually start here. Um, yeah. Uh, I think it would be good to, you know, update this YC document with all these things. Um, and then feel free to ask some follow-up questions, right? Our goal is to make this as long as possible so that we have as much context for each of these answers, but then, you know, maybe we'll, we'll figure out how to make it succinct after and punch. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
