**Status:** Adopted

## 1. Product Vision: A Foundational Utility for AI-Powered Work

Agipo is a tool designed to be as essential to the modern knowledge worker as the spreadsheet or word processor was to previous generations. It is a visual, intuitive platform for defining, automating, and scaling professional workflows.

Our vision is to empower every user to become a "10x worker" by providing them with the tools to codify their unique expertise and leverage AI as a personal force multiplier.

## 2. The Core User Experience: From Language to Workflow

The Agipo experience is built on a simple, powerful loop:

1.  **Describe:** The user describes a task or workflow in natural language.
2.  **Visualize:** Agipo instantly translates this description into a visual, node-based workflow diagram.
3.  **Refine:** The user interacts with the diagram, moving nodes, adding steps, or asking the AI to "split" a complex node into a more granular sub-workflow.
4.  **Execute:** The user runs the workflow, with Agipo's AI executing the steps.
5.  **Iterate:** The user can easily modify and improve their workflows over time, creating a library of personal, automated processes.

## 3. Key Features & Concepts

### 3.1 The Visual Workflow Canvas

This is the heart of the Agipo interface, powered by a flexible node-based UI.

-   **Nodes as IPO Steps:** Each node on the canvas represents a single Input-Process-Output step.
-   **Edges as Data Flow:** Lines connecting the nodes show the flow of data, where the output of one node becomes the input for the next.
-   **Natural Language Creation:** Users can create new nodes and workflows simply by typing what they want to happen next.

### 3.2 Dynamic & Bespoke Nodes

This is Agipo's key differentiator from rigid, API-based automation tools.

-   **Freedom from Pre-defined Actions:** Unlike tools that offer a fixed menu of integrations (e.g., "Send a Slack message"), Agipo's nodes are not limited to specific third-party APIs.
-   **AI-Generated Scripts:** Based on the user's natural language request, Agipo's AI can generate bespoke scripts or actions for a node to perform. This could be anything from summarizing text, to analyzing data, to formatting a document in a specific way. This allows for an infinite range of possibilities.

### 3.3 AI-Assisted Refinement

Agipo is not just a passive tool; it's an active partner in helping users clarify their thinking.

-   **Node Decomposition ("Splitting"):** A user can select a high-level node (e.g., "Analyze quarterly sales data") and ask Agipo to break it down. The AI will suggest a multi-step sub-workflow (e.g., 1. "Import data from source," 2. "Clean and format data," 3. "Identify top 5 trends," 4. "Generate summary report"). This makes it easy to go from a rough idea to a detailed, actionable plan.
-   **Conditional Logic:** The AI can help insert conditional branches into the workflow (e.g., "If the feedback is positive, do X; if it's negative, do Y").

### 3.4 The Workflow Marketplace (Future Vision)

As users build and perfect their personal workflows, Agipo will become a repository of codified expertise.

-   **Monetizing Expertise:** In the future, users will be able to package and sell their most effective workflows on a marketplace. A marketing expert could sell their "New Product Launch" workflow, or a financial analyst could sell their "Quarterly Earnings Analysis" workflow.
-   **A New Economy of Skills:** This creates a new way for professionals to monetize their unique skills and processes, beyond direct employment.
