# Home Page – Planning Draft

## Page Goals
- Communicate AGIPO’s agent-orchestration value clearly within the first screen.
- Showcase live automation state (kanban + activity) to build trust and transparency.
- Provide on-ramps into creation (natural language prompt) and discovery (marketplace).
- Reinforce collaboration and performance signals for teams adopting AGIPO.

## Primary Audience
- Knowledge workers and team leads evaluating AGIPO for automation workflows.
- Existing users returning to monitor and adjust active agents.

## Layout Overview
1. **Hero Header**
   - Headline: “Orchestrate your AI workforce.”
   - Supporting copy emphasizing multi-agent transparency and marketplace access.
   - Primary CTA `Create an agent`, secondary `Browse marketplace`.
   - Optional subtle illustration/background referencing agent nodes.

2. **Agent Task Kanban (Primary Canvas)**
   - Columns: `Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Completed`.
   - Cards display agent avatar/icon, task title, status badge, last activity timestamp, quick actions (pause, inspect, rerun).
   - Hover reveals mini metrics (success rate, run time).

3. **Live Activity & Alerts Sidebar**
   - Stream of recent executions, failures, self-heal events.
   - Filter chips (All, Success, Errors, Alerts).
   - Inline action to investigate or acknowledge issues.

4. **Agent Metrics Snapshot**
   - Compact tiles/layer above or below kanban: agents running, success rate, avg turnaround, queued tasks.
   - Sparkline or trend indicator to convey trajectory.

5. **Natural Language Prompt Panel**
   - Conversational input: “Describe the agent you need…”
   - Suggested prompts carousel for quick-start templates.
   - “See how it works” link to highlight natural language workflow.

6. **Marketplace Spotlight**
   - Grid of featured agents with tags (e.g., Support, Ops, Marketing).
   - Card elements: title, rating, usage count, quick “Add to workspace”.
   - CTA to view full marketplace.

7. **Collaboration & Workspace Context**
   - Banner or footer bar showing workspace name, active collaborators, recent edits.
   - Link to activity logs or version history.

8. **Footer**
   - Links: Roadmap, Documentation, Community, Status, Terms.
   - Subtext reinforcing transparency/monitoring.

## UI Tone & Styling Notes
- Emphasize scannability: high-contrast columns, consistent badges, deliberate whitespace.
- Use agent avatars/icons sparingly to avoid visual clutter; rely on clear typography.
- Activity feed should feel “live” with subtle motion (pulsing dots, sliding entries).
- Marketplace cards align with overall brand; keep CTA buttons consistent with hero.

## Content Hooks
- Rotating subheadline messaging (e.g., “Automate support triage”, “Generate financial reports”).
- Testimonials/quote chip integrated near marketplace section if space permits.
- Tooltips or info icons to reinforce trust (e.g., “Agents run in your browser via WebContainers”).

## Next Steps
- Produce hi-fi static HTML mock representing layout + hierarchy.
- Iterate with PM on copy, CTA phrasing, and component priority.
- Validate responsive behavior (tablet + mobile variants) before implementation.
