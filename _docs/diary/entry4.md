# Entry 4 – Workflow Generator Arrival  
**Date:** {{DATE:today}}  
**Author:** Engineering + Product Notes

## Executive Summary

We reached a significant milestone today: the “Workflow Generator” experiment is live and already reshaping how we approach browser-based runtime orchestration. Over the past cycles we took the learnings from the original WebContainer testbed—specifically, dynamically composing node graphs, piping data between scripts, and supporting multi-layer documentation—and rebuilt the experience around our preferred slice-based architecture. This entry captures where we are, why the change matters, and what comes next.

## What We’ve Delivered So Far

### 1. Multi-Layer Node Authoring (Flow / Spec / Code)
- Every node still exposes three synchronized perspectives:
  - **Flow:** shorthand narrative for a teammate to scan and understand the transformation.
  - **Spec:** structured description of inputs, process, and outputs.
  - **Code:** executable Node.js snippet ready for WebContainer execution.
- This design continues to be the foundation for scannability and collaborative authoring; the Workflow Generator preserves all of it.

### 2. Browser-Native Execution with WebContainers
- Users can add nodes, connect them, and run the pipeline directly in their browser.
- Dependency management (npm install) and execution logs remain visible through the console sidebar.
- Output streaming, run-state indicators, and script generation are identical to the earlier test—no regressions.

### 3. Architectural Realignment (Zustand Slices + Services)
- The new experiment adopts the documented Store-Slice pattern:
  - `workflowSlice` handles nodes/edges, React Flow events, and layer toggling.
  - `executionSlice` manages install/run lifecycle, console output, and node running states.
  - `webcontainerSlice` boots and tears down the runtime cleanly.
- WebContainer logic now lives in explicit services (`webcontainerService`, `workflowExecutionService`) rather than inside a monolithic hook.
- Components remain stateless shells that read/write via the composed store (`useWorkflowGeneratorStore`), greatly simplifying maintenance and future feature additions.

### 4. Domain Documentation and Data Modeling
- Captured canonical tables for agents, workflows, nodes, tool assignments, and conversational sessions in `_docs/Engineering/workflow-domain-tables.md`.
- Established the future-facing narrative: agents own workflows (which double as “tools”), assignments define when to invoke them, and sessions track how they’re used.

## Why We’re Retiring the Old WebContainer Test

- **Architectural alignment:** The original prototype relied on a single `useOrchestrator` hook that mixed UI state, domain logic, and WebContainer plumbing. The Workflow Generator separates these concerns, matching our broader engineering guidelines.
- **Maintainability:** Slice-based state makes it trivial to add features (e.g., persisted workflows, remote loading) without touching the execution engine.
- **Extensibility:** Services encapsulate runtime behavior, making it easier to swap in future execution targets or add telemetry.
- **Documentation & Onboarding:** The new experiment’s README, store slices, and domain tables offer a much clearer entry point for teammates.

Next steps include verifying feature parity thoroughly, then formally deprecating `app/experiments/webcontainer-test`.

## What’s Next

1. **Workflow Persistence:** Move away from hard-coded initial nodes—back workflows via mock JSON, then a real API, so both the workflow generator and future AI agents can fetch definitions consistently.
2. **Agent Integration:** Wrap backend workflow services as AI SDK `Agent` tools so server-side agents can load/list workflows and eventually trigger executions.
3. **Security & API Keys:** Solidify the “no secrets in WebContainer” stance—route all privileged calls through backend proxies with scoped tokens.
4. **Testing & Parity Checks:** Run through the original experiment’s regressions (install failures, multi-node chains, layer editing) to confirm everything behaves as expected in the new architecture.
5. **UX Enhancements:** Lean on the planner in `_docs/UXD/Pages/workflow/requirements.md` to improve multi-layer visualization, context summaries, and error surfacing.

## Closing Thoughts

This phase marks the transition from an exploratory prototype to a maintainable foundation. We now have:
- A modern architecture that mirrors our engineering principles.
- Clear domain documentation to support upcoming agent features.
- A path to eliminate legacy experiments without sacrificing functionality.

From here, the focus shifts to connecting the Workflow Generator with persistent data, agents, and richer tooling. The groundwork is in place. Let’s keep the momentum.*** End Patch
