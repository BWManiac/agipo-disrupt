Of course. This is a great way to explore the capabilities of the system we've built. Here are several code snippets to test different scenarios, along with an important explanation about `import` vs. `require`.

### A Quick Note: `import` vs. `require()`

You asked if `import` statements will work. **They will not work in our current setup.**

The Node.js environment running inside our WebContainer is a standard CommonJS environment. This means it expects modules to be loaded using the `require()` syntax.

To use ES Module `import` syntax, we would need to do extra work inside the container, such as naming our files with a `.mjs` extension or creating a `package.json` file with `"type": "module"`. Since our current orchestrator creates simple `.js` files, you must stick to `require()` for now.

### Test Case 1: Using a Built-in Node.js Module

This test proves that we have a real, functional Node.js environment with access to its standard library.

*   **Node A Code:**
```javascript
const os = require('os');
console.log(os.platform());
```
*   **Expected Output:** You should see the operating system platform of the container, which will likely be `linux`.

### Test Case 2: A Three-Node Data Pipe

This tests if our piping logic holds for a chain longer than two nodes.

*   **Node A Code:**
```javascript
// This node starts the chain.
process.stdout.write("START");
```

*   **Node B Code (connect A to B):**
```javascript
// This node receives from A and passes to C.
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin });

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  process.stdout.write(line + "->MIDDLE");
});
```

*   **Node C Code (connect B to C):**
```javascript
// This node receives from B and prints the final output.
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin });

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  console.log(line + "->END");
});
```

*   **Expected Output:**
```
START->MIDDLE->END
```

---

### Test Case 3: Writing to Standard Error (`stderr`)

This demonstrates that our output panel captures `stderr` as well as `stdout`, which is crucial for seeing error messages.

*   **Node A Code:**
```javascript
console.log("This is a standard log message.");
console.error("This is an error message.");
```

*   **Expected Output:** You should see both lines in the output panel. This confirms we are correctly capturing both output streams.
```
This is a standard log message.
This is an error message.
```

---

### Test Case 4: A More Complex Disconnected Graph

This is a more advanced version of **Test #3** to ensure the parallel execution logic is solid.

1.  Create a two-node chain (`A -> B`) like the "Hello World" example.
2.  Create a completely separate, third node (`C`) on the canvas.
3.  Click "Run".

*   **Node A Code:** `console.log("Hello");`
*   **Node B Code (connect A to B):**
```javascript
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin });
rl.on('line', (line) => console.log(line + " World"));
```
*   **Node C Code (leave disconnected):** `console.log("I ran in parallel!");`

*   **Expected Output:** You should see both results, confirming the chain ran correctly and the isolated node also ran by itself. The order may vary.
```
Hello World
I ran in parallel!
```
