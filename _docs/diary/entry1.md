Of course. It's great to bring another developer into the loop. Here is a comprehensive summary of our progress on the MVP so far.

### Project Brief: Node-Based Execution Engine MVP

To get you up to speed, we are building a visual, node-based workflow editor in the browser. The core goal is to allow a user to place nodes containing JavaScript code on a canvas, connect them to pipe data, and execute the resulting graph using WebContainers. All of our work has been consolidated into a single file for this experimental phase: `app/experiments/webcontainer-test/page.tsx`.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Basic Canvas

Our first step was to get the foundational pieces in place.
1.  **Dependencies:** We installed `@xyflow/react` (the new name for React Flow), `zustand` for state management, and `@webcontainer/api` for in-browser execution.
2.  **Next.js Configuration:** We modified `next.config.ts` to add the required COOP/COEP headers, which are a prerequisite for `SharedArrayBuffer` used by WebContainer.
3.  **Routing:** We created the main experiment page. We initially encountered a `404 Not Found` error because we placed our page in `app/_experiments`, which Next.js treats as a private, non-routable folder. We fixed this by renaming it to `app/experiments`.
4.  **Styling:** We also fixed a build error where the app couldn't find `reactflow/dist/style.css`. We updated the import path to `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css` to match the new package name.

### Phase 2: UI & State Management

With the environment ready, we built the interactive canvas.
1.  **Stateful Canvas:** We implemented a React Flow canvas using the `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` hooks (which are built on Zustand). This provides out-of-the-box state management for all user interactions.
2.  **Core UI Features:** The UI now fully supports adding, deleting, moving, and connecting nodes.
3.  **State Visualization:** For clear debugging, we added a sidebar that displays the raw JSON of the `nodes` and `edges` arrays, which updates in real-time as you interact with the canvas. This completes the work for **Tests #4, #5, and #7**.

### Phase 3: WebContainer & Single Node Execution

This was the most complex phase, where we integrated the execution engine and went through several rounds of debugging.
1.  **WebContainer Boot:** The app now boots a WebContainer instance on page load and displays a loading status. This covers **Test #10**.
2.  **Custom Code Nodes:** We replaced the default nodes with a custom React component containing a `<textarea>`. This allows users to write and edit code directly inside each node, satisfying **Test #6**.
3.  **Execution Logic ("Run" Button):** We implemented the `onRun` function. This is where we hit and solved a few critical bugs:
    *   **Bug 1: `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`:** Our initial attempt to write a file (`fs.writeFile`) and then immediately execute it (`spawn`) failed. The Node.js process couldn't find the file we had just told it to create.
    *   **Diagnosis:** We changed the `spawn` command to `ls -l /` to inspect the container's file system. The output showed that `/index.js` was indeed missing, confirming a race condition.
    *   **Bug 2: `EACCES: permission denied`:** Our first attempt at a fix involved using a more robust `sh -c "echo '...' > /index.js && node /index.js"` command. This failed because we didn't have permission to write to the root (`/`) directory.
    *   **Solution:** We updated the command to write to the `/tmp` directory, which is world-writable. The final, stable command is: `sh -c "echo '...' > /tmp/index.js && node /tmp/index.js"`.
4.  **Visual Feedback:** To improve the user experience, we added an `isRunning` state to our nodes. When you click "Run", the border of the executing node turns green and reverts back after the process finishes.

### Current Status

We have successfully implemented a robust solution for **single-node execution**. You can write code in the first node, click run, see it highlight, and view the output in the side panel. This validates **Tests #1, #6, #8, #9, and #10**.

We are now ready to begin the final step.

### Next Step: Full Graph Execution (Piping)

The last remaining task is **Step 4**. We need to enhance the `onRun` function to be graph-aware. It will need to analyze the `nodes` and `edges` to build and execute piped shell commands (e.g., `... | node /tmp/node-2.js`), which will finally validate **Test #2** and **Test #3**.
