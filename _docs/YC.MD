# YC Application Questions (Winter 2026)

## Founders

### Question: Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
**Answer:** It's all been me. None of it has been done by a non-founder. I am a technical product manager by trade. I've done front-end, back-end, AI model development, and infrastructure for AGIPO. I've pretty much handled everything myself.

### Question: Are you looking for a cofounder?
**Answer:** Yes, I am looking for a co-founder. While I am a very strong technical product manager and have been able to implement complex solutions myself, I realize it's crucial to have someone more focused on the technical implementation. My strengths are more aligned with go-to-market strategies, product vision, sales, and other business aspects, and a co-founder would allow me to focus on these areas while ensuring robust technical development. The ideal co-founder would be aligned with my vision, possess a strong sense of how to manage a team, and be able to translate product vision into actionable steps. I'm looking for someone I can genuinely collaborate and have fun with.

## Founder Video

### Question: Please record a one minute video introducing the founder(s).
**Answer:** (Script)

"Hi, I'm Jacobzen, and I'm building AGIPO.

My core belief is that 90% of knowledge work is just data transformation. We train *people* to do this work through conversation and teaching, but we force our *software* into rigid, pre-built blocks. This is fundamentally broken.

AGIPO fixes this. It's a platform to hire and manage an AI workforce, but the magic is how you train them. You onboard an agent just like a new employee: by talking to them. You explain your unique workflow, and AGIPO translates your process into a powerful, automated tool.

This is more than just automation. We're building truly collaborative AI partners and creating the future of how people and software work together."

## Company

### Question: Company name*
**Answer:** AGIPO

### Question: Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.*
**Answer:** A platform to hire, manage, and create AI agents.

### Question: Company URL, if any
**Answer:** AGIPO.app

### Question: If you have a demo, attach it below. (Anything that shows us how the product works. Please limit to 3 minutes or 100 MB.)
**Answer:** We do have a demo. For the demo, I'd like to show the following in steps:
1.  **Workflow/Tool Creation:** Demonstrate how to create a workflow or a tool from scratch.
2.  **Agent Creation & Assignment:** Show the basics of creating an AI agent and assigning the newly created workflow/tool to it.
3.  **Agent Interaction:** Showcase chatting with the agent, demonstrating its ability to call the assigned tool.
4.  **Marketplace Overview:** Provide a glimpse of the marketplace interface.
5.  **Table Integration:** Highlight the integration of tables as a first-class citizen within the platform.

### Question: Please provide a link to the product, if any.
**Answer:** AGIPO.app

### Question: If login credentials are required for the link above, enter them here.
**Answer:**

### Question: What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
**Answer:** AGIPO is a platform where people can easily hire, manage, and create their own AI agents. These agents are designed to be humanized, having memory, being chattable, and capable of iterating and improving through training, similar to a human. Unlike existing workflow automation tools that force users to conform to available nodes, AGIPO will programmatically generate nodes from scratch with code, offering greater flexibility. The core problem we're solving is making it easy for people to consume integrations that other people create, addressing the difficulty users face with tools like N8N or Zapier. A key differentiator is our focus on the marketplace, making it a main part of the product to facilitate the sharing of agent creations, rather than an afterthought.

### Question: Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC? (We're looking at City A, Country A, City B, Country B)
**Answer:** I currently live in L.A., but I would be looking at living in either New York or San Francisco.

### Question: Explain your decision regarding location.
**Answer:** My ultimate commitment is to do whatever is best for the product's success. Given that AGIPO is geared towards a variety of white-collar workers, I believe New York is a better location due to my existing network and its strength for networking and discovery beyond just the SaaS sector. This also helps to get out of a bubble, as I envision the product being useful for both white-collar workers and general consumers for managing their lives and making agents accessible.

## Progress

### Question: How far along are you?
**Answer:** I am pretty early into this. I built a prototype two months ago, and then completely redid everything last week after receiving extensive feedback from investors and others at TechCrunch Disrupt. This most recent iteration is very new.

### Question: How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full time? Please explain.
**Answer:** I left my job in January of 2025 to pursue and learn more about this space, and to learn how to code. This is a product I've wanted to build for a very long time.

### Question: What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product? (Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.)
**Answer:** Our current tech stack includes: Supabase for database tables, Next.js for the main application, Zustand for state management, a React Native front-end for mobile (currently in beta), Vercel for deployment, and the AI SDK for AI model integration. The UI elements are built with ChatCN.

### Question: Are people using your product?
**Answer:** Yes, I have a few beta testers.

### Question: How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying you? Who is paying you the most, and how much do they pay you?
**Answer:** I have a few beta testers, and none of them are currently paying. I also have a small pipeline of people who have expressed strong interest in testing the product once it's out of beta.

### Question: Do you have revenue?
**Answer:** No, not yet.

### Question: If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
**Answer:** I have not applied with the same idea in a previous batch.

### Question: If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.
**Answer:** I have not participated in or committed to any incubator, accelerator, or pre-accelerator programs.

## Idea

### Question: Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
**Answer:** I have domain expertise in marketplaces and consumer products. I know people need this because I've spoken to many users on both sides of the marketplace. For those creating workflow automations, they often struggle with tools like N8N or Zapier due to difficulty in understanding how to use them. On the agent purchasing side, I spoke to a venture capitalist who had spent over $200 on courses and N8N workflows, but found it incredibly hard to integrate them into her life. Our product solves these problems by making it easy for people to consume and integrate agent creations.

### Question: Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
**Answer:** Our main competitors are N8N and Zapier, along with a few smaller players. What I understand that they don't is that their marketplaces are often an afterthought, whereas for AGIPO, the marketplace is a central part of the product. Making it easy for people to share their creations is critical. Additionally, I believe in humanizing AI agents. Many N8N workflows are stateless, but AGIPO's agents will have memory, be chattable, and be capable of iteration, improvement, and training like a human. Furthermore, N8N and Zapier often force users to conform to their available nodes, while AGIPO aims to programmatically generate nodes from scratch with code, offering greater flexibility.

### Question: How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
**Answer:** We envision several potential business models. Given AGIPO is a multi-sided marketplace, users can create and buy agents, and businesses can submit RFPs (similar to Fiverr). The most straightforward approach is a credit-based system, charging per run, with potentially higher costs for more expensive API calls, or an upcharge on API costs. Alternatively, for workflow creators, they could price their workflows, and we would take a commission. This charges for perceived value rather than just runs. I've observed that people building automations for others using tools like N8N often charge thousands of dollars, far exceeding typical API costs, indicating significant value capture potential.

### Question: Which category best applies to your company?
**Answer:** AI agent, SaaS, Marketplace.

### Question: If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
**Answer:** Yes, one other idea is an app called ENNA (E-N-N-A), a consumer-facing application designed for users to brain dump everything, which is then automatically organized into predefined categories. The goal is to easily categorize people's thoughts, feelings, and actions.

## Equity

### Question: Have you formed ANY legal entity yet? (This can be in the US, or your home country or another country)
**Answer:** No.

### Question: If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g., CEO).
**Answer:** As the sole founder currently, the ownership would be entirely mine. With a co-founder, we would determine an equitable split.

### Question: Have you taken any investment yet?
**Answer:** No.

### Question: Are you currently fundraising?
**Answer:** Yes, I started speaking to investors at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. Many have requested to see the MVP, and I am actively engaging with them.

## Curious

### Question: What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?
**Answer:** I believe Y Combinator can provide the crucial initial step forward for AGIPO. My experience as a product manager has equipped me to lead teams and structure projects, but I need assistance with the very early stages of development (the "zero to point one"). I learn best when surrounded by people pursuing similar goals, and YC offers that environment. Many investors I spoke to at TechCrunch Disrupt encouraged me to apply. I have not yet attended any YC events.

### Question: How did you hear about Y Combinator?
**Answer:** I've been interested in entrepreneurship since high school and have been following Y Combinator ever since, likely discovering it via YouTube or similar platforms. I don't recall the exact moment I heard about it.
