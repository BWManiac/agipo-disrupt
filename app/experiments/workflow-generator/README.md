## Workflow Generator Experiment

This experiment recreates the WebContainer workflow MVP using the project’s slice-based Zustand architecture. It keeps the familiar canvas UI while isolating state management and side effects into cohesive slices and services. Use it to validate store patterns, dependency installs, and multi-node execution before retiring the older `webcontainer-test`.
